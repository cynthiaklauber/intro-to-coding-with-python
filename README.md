# Intro to Coding with Python

## Workshop Goals

- Understand the tools needed to code
  - Execute/run code - Python 3 - software needed to execute python code
  - Write/edit code - VSCode - popular text editor
  - Save/version code - git - modern version control software
  - Store/share code - GitHub - social media for code
- Become comfortable with making trying things you don't completely understand
  - Practicing breaking down seemingly unachievable goals into smaller parts until you have easy to accomplish tasks
- Become confident in your ability to problem solve in the coding arena

## Why Is This Important

I want you to be able to feel empowered to take control of the digital world around you. The more information and understanding you have about how it works, the better you can make decisions about how to best participate in it.

There are so many cool things you can do.

Many future ethical decisions that affect entire societies will be made by the people writing the code that powers the world. You should be involved in helping to make sure those decisions are made thoughtfully.

## Local Participation

If you have setup an SSH key with GitHub and installed Jupyter notebooks locally then this way should work. Otherwise, skip down to [online participation](#online-participation).

- From the command line navigate into your _git_ directory `cd ~/git`
- Clone this repo `git clone git@github.com:bcope/intro-to-coding-with-python.git`
- Start a Jupyter Notebook server `jupyter notebook`
- Navigate to `/intro-to-coding-with-python/session-02-basics/session-02-exercises.ipynb`

## Online Participation

You can participate through a browser by going to [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/) and pasting this URL `https://github.com/bcope/intro-to-coding-with-python` into the GitHub repository name or URL box.

Then navigate to `/session-02-basics/session-02-exercises.ipynb`.
